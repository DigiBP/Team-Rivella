## Introduction 

Clinical research involves the examination of various elements related to a disease, such as its symptoms, risk factors, and pathophysiology. Clinical Trials are interventional investigations conducted on human volunteers and patients to evaluate the effectiveness of a therapetuic drug or medical device (Kandi & Vadakedath, 2023). Clinical trials include various phases starting from Phase 0, performing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. Phase 1 is conducted in 10-100 healthy volunteers to to establish safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Phase 2 trials is conducted in a sample size of 100-300 patients, to establish the efficacy of the medical intervention. Phase 3 trials are conducted on 1000-3000 patients to confirm the safety and efficacy, and establish the efficacy of the drug. Finally, in Phase 4 post-marketing studies, the drug effect is monitered in the real world to determine drug-drug interactions and drug-disease interactions. Table 1 provides a brief summary of all the clinical trial phases (Rohilla et. al.,2013).

Business process modelling has been recognized as an important means in the reorganization of management processes, and there are considerable opportunities to automate Clinical trial workflows. Through our research, we have determined that optimizing and digitalizing clinical trials could potentially: 
- Improve Flexibility
- Increase Patient Recruitment
- Reduce paper and manual workload
- Shorten Clinical Trial Timelines
- Reduce Costs
  
### Project Goals
1. Automation and optimization of the patient screening and patient recruitment process in Phase 1 clinical trials 
2. Digitize a patient database to ease updates and clinical trial assessment
